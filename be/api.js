   {
      "estimatedTimeSpent": "1-2 hours",
      "explanation": "Extending an existing DTO (Data Transfer Object) to include a new field is typically a quick task. It requires adding a new property to the DTO class and ensuring it's correctly used in any serialization/deserialization logic, as well as updating associated API endpoints if required. Based on RA-78, which involved similar DTO modification work and had a total time spent of approximately 11.5 hours, the task of adding a single field is much less involved and should therefore be on the lower end of the effort spectrum. Given that no issues related to database migration or complex business logic were indicated, a 1-2 hours range is estimated.",
